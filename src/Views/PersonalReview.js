          I have been using this electric kettle for 3 years now. It is
          surprisingly durable for how inexpensive it is. I have had 2 other
          electric kettles, one glass, and another plastic like this one. I
          prefer using the plastic ones though. <br />
          <br />
          This electric kettle is very useful for boiling water fast. It's
          faster than filling up a regular kettle and putting it on the stove.
          And the automatic turn off when it's boiled is nice, because if you
          forget you boiled water your house doesn't burn down. The less water
          you put in it the faster it boils, but even at full load it still
          boils in about 3 mins. You can even take it off boil part way and
          still have hot water not hot enough to burn your mouth, but hot enough
          to warm your soul.
          <br />
          <br />I use this kettle multiple times a day more often than using the
          microwave. I usually use it to make tea or coffee.
